<h1>Spotify Color Playlist Generator</h1>

I worked with Spotify's API and Python's Spotipy library to develop an application that builds a 
unique playlist based on user preferences. The way it works is the user specifies what artists they 
want to be in the playlist. Then, the program finds those artists and displays all their albums for the 
user to choose from. All the user has to do is select their favorite albums (as many as they want), and then they input 
one of the color options to define the "sound" of their new playlist. Each color is assigned to specific bounds
within the different sound aspects of individual songs. If the song succeeds the aspects of the color, then it is placed 
in the playlist. 


Currently, this is just a Python script with Flask to help with authentication, but I do have the goals of turning 
it into a legitimate web app for humans to utilize.
